    <h3>The 9th Amendment, What does it mean?</h3>

    <p>The 9th Amendment to the Constitution was added during the first congress held by the United States along with nine other amendments that 
        are collectively known as the Bill of Rights. Essentially, the 9th Amendment states that just because certain rights are enumerated in 
        the Constitution, it does not imply that the Constitution does not protect those rights that aren’t enumerated. The Amendment itself doesn't 
        guarantee any substantive rights. Rather, it is seen more as a rule of construction that helps provide a lens through which the other amendments
         found in the Bill of Rights can be read. Interestingly, since its ratification, the ninth amendment has never once constituted the main basis for 
         any supreme court rulings. However, since this amendment is used primarily as a rule of construction, this fact is not surprising and in no way lessens 
         the importance of this amendment.  </p>

    <h3>Some Background/History</h3>

    <p>In its original form, the Constitution did not contain a Bill of Rights. Since the federal government would (ideally) have limited and enumerated powers, 
        many of the Framers saw no need to include a list of rights. In fact, many felt it could be a dangerous move since it could imply that the national 
        government had more powers than those enumerated. It was also feared that the addition of a Bill of Rights could be misinterpreted to mean that certain 
        rights were protected by the government while others weren’t. </p>

        <P>“why, for instance, should it be said that the liberty of the press shall not be restricted, when no power is given [in the constitution] by which 
            restrictions may be imposed?”
            -Alexander Hamilton</P>
        
    <p>While the question of the addition of a Bill of Rights was hotly contested and downright opposed by many delegates at the Constitutional Convention, the 
        sentiment was quite different in many state conventions. Generally, these state conventions were favorable to the idea of including a Bill of Rights, and 
        many of them only ratified the Constitution with the understanding that a Bill of Rights would be added later on. Thus, during the First session of the 
        United States Congress, twelve constitutional amendments were proposed. Ten of these passed. Amendments one through eight guaranteed the protection of 
        substantive and specific rights. The ninth amendment was added to placate those who worried about the inherent dangers of having some specific rights 
        listed and protected. Its purpose is and has been to ensure that the Bill of Rights can not be used to limit non enumerated rights. The ninth amendment 
        has been evoked sparingly over the years. Prior to 1965 it only made limited legal appearances, most notably the Supreme Court case US Public Workers v Mitchell (1947). 
        In more recent times, the amendment played a part in two major Supreme Court cases.</p>

        <h3>Noteable Cases</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>United Public Workers v. Mitchell(1947): This case revolved around a group of federal employees who were accused of violating the Hatch Act, which 
                prohibits employees of the executive branch from engaging in select political activities. It was found that only one of the men out of the group had 
                actually violated the act. His lawyers argued that The Hatch Act violated the ninth and tenth amendment and was therefore unconstitutional. Despite this 
                argument, the Supreme Court upheld the circuit court and found that The Hatch Act was indeed constitutional.</li>

            <li>Griswald v. Connecticut(1965): In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that states could not make it illegal for married couples to use contraception. 
                This ruling effectively legalized birth control in the United States. In this case, the ninth amendment was cited to show that citizens do in fact enjoy 
                a right to privacy, despite it not being specifically enumerated. The court stated that the Constitution protects “penumbral rights of privacy and repose”. 
                Interestingly, while the implied right to privacy still stands, its basis solely on the auspices of the ninth amendment does not.</li>

            <li>Roe v. Wade(1973): In this case, the district court held that the ninth amendment protected the right to terminate a fetus. Upon reaching the Supreme Court the 
                justices, instead of citing the ninth amendment, chose to contend that the right was “founded in the fourteenth [amendments] concept of personal liberty and restrictions 
                upon state action”. Despite that, the case Griswald v Connecticut was cited as precedent for the existence of a right to privacy. In 2022 Roe v. Wade was overruled, and 
                the ability to control the legality of abortions was returned to the states. The justices also stated that, since the weight of the Roe decision rested primarily on the 
                back of the fourteenth amendment, cases that more heavily involved the ninth amendment such as the Griswald case still held precedent and the implied right to privacy 
                was still protected. </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>

        <p>Although rarely used to argue cases before the supreme court, the Ninth Amendment to the Constitution is nonetheless essential to understanding the intention of the Bill of Rights 
            and the Constitution as a whole. It ensures that readers understand that there are other rights not expilicity stated that are protected under the constitution. 
            This quote by Supreme Court Justice Arthur Goldberg does an amazing job in showcasing the importance of the nineth amendment: “[The Amendment] shows a belief of the constitution’s 
            authors that fundamental rights exist that are not expressly enumerated in the first eight amendments an intent that the list of rights included there not to be deemed exhaustive.”
