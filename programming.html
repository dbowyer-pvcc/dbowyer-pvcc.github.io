        <li>Write the program code in appropriate language based on the algorithm.</li>
        <li>Enter the program and save.</li>
        <li>Execute the program.</li>
        <li>Test the program, find errors and debug, then retest.</li>
        <li>Document and evaluate the program.</li>

    <h2>Two Popular Search Techniques</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Sequential Search: Search from top to bottom or bottom to top, one item at a time.</li>
        <li>Binary Search: Only works if data is SORTED first. Start in the middle, then go to half of that, ect.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Two Classic Program Goals</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Efficiency: Program takes minimal time and/or resources.</li>
        <li>Correctness: Program runs in expected ways and works for all expected conditions.</li>
    </ol>

        <tr>
            <td>Performance Testing</td>

        <tr>
            <td>Regression Testing</td>

        <tr>

    <h3>Software testing is done to detect:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Archetural Flaws</li>
        <li>Poor design decisions</li>
        <li>Invalid or incorrect functionality</li>
        <li>Security vulnerablities</li>
        <li>Scalability issues</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Testing Best Practices:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Continous Testing:  Project teams test each build as it becomes available. This type of 
         software testing relies on test automation that is integrated with the deployment process. It enables software to be 
         validated in realistic test environments earlier in the process improving design and reducing risks.</li>
        <li>Configuration Managment: Organizations centrally maintain test assets and track what software builds to test. Teams gain 
            access to assets such as code, requirements, design documents, models, test scripts and test results. 
            Good systems include user authentication and audit trails to help teams meet compliance requirements with minimal administrative effort.</li>
        <li>Service Virtualization: Testing environments may not be available, especially early in code development. Service virtualization simulates 
            the services and systems that are missing or not yet completed, enabling teams to reduce dependencies and test sooner. They can 
            reuse, deploy and change a configuration to test different scenarios without having to modify the original environment.</li>
        <li>Defect or "Bug Tracking":Monitoring defects is important to both testing and development teams for measuring and improving quality. 
            Automated tools allow teams to track defects, measure their scope and impact, and uncover related issues. </li>
        <li>Metrics and Reporting:  Reporting and analytics enable team members to share status, goals and test results. Advanced tools integrate 
            project metrics and present results in a dashboard. Teams quickly see the overall health of a project and can monitor relationships 
            between test, development and other project elements.</li>
